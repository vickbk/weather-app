# Frontend Mentor - Weather app solution with some Kendoreact Free Components

This is a solution to the [Weather app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/weather-app-K1FhddVm49). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
In addition I included the [KendoReact Free Components challenge from dev.to](https://dev.to/devteam/join-the-latest-kendoreact-free-components-challenge-3000-in-prizes-4fch?) as well.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for weather information by entering a location in the search bar
- View current weather conditions including temperature, weather icon, and location details
- See additional weather metrics like "feels like" temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and precipitation amounts
- Browse a 7-day weather forecast with daily high/low temperatures and weather icons
- View an hourly forecast showing temperature changes throughout the day
- Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
- Toggle between Imperial and Metric measurement units via the units dropdown
- Switch between specific temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) and measurement units for wind speed (km/h and mph) and precipitation (millimeters) via the units dropdown
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
